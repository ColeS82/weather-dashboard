# Weather Dashboard

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This application retrieves data from another application's API and uses it in to display weather information. 

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT develop an application that will retrieve weather information about any city that a user may search
SO THAT any user can dress for the weather.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
